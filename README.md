# KnoxVault Cloud Vault Application
Knoxvault is a secure and user-friendly cloud-based vault application that provides users with a two-factor authentication mechanism using facial recognition and password authentication. It allows users to register and set up their faces for authentication. Once logged in, users can perform various operations on their files, including viewing, modifying, downloading, and deleting. The application also tracks the time of the user's last access and last login.

```
 DATABASE_URL='mysql+pymysql://##YOUR AWS RDS URL OR LOCAL DATABASE URL##/## DB NAME ##'
ACCESS_KEY_ID='## your access key for S3 bucket ##'
ACCESS_SECRET_KEY='## secret key for bucket ##'
BUCKET_NAME='## bucket name ##'

```
